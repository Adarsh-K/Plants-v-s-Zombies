# Plants v/s Zombies

I've developed a clone for the famous game- Plants v/s Zombies.

This repo includes the UML & my entire code. **For running the game** please download src/Game.

I've used **Object Oriented Programming** with many *design patterns* like Singleton, Facade, etc. The GUI is developed using JavaFX & I've used **Multi-threading** for it's smooth functioning.

This is my final project for the course Advanced Programming.
